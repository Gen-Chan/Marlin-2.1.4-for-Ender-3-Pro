# Marlin-2.1.4-for-Ender-3-Pro
This is an example of a Marlin config to run on a **Creatily Ender 3 Pro** with **Silent Board 4.2.7, BL-Touch, Out of Filament Sensor**.

I have struggled to let Marlin work well on my Ender 3 Pro. So I decided to share my config and binary with you. May it give you the inspiration you need to make it run on your setup.

My **Ender 3 Pro** has a replaced Board, I installed the **4.2.7 Board**, the original creality **BL-Touch** and an **Out of Filament Sensor** i found on Amazon. I also have a 2nd Z-Step-Motor, but this is not relevant for the firmware in this case.
